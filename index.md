# The Eyes-Free Arch Iso

[about](/about.md)  [download](/download.md)

This is TalkingArch, a respin of the [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/) live iso modified to include speech and braille output for blind and visually impaired users.
[Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/) is designed to be simple, lightweight and flexible.
TalkingArch retains all the features of the Arch Linux live image, but adds speech and braille packages to make it possible for blind and visually impaired users to install Arch Linux eyes-free.
Feel free to visit [download page](/download.md) to grab the latest build of the iso image, which will happily run from either a DVD or from a USB stick.
Instructions for writing the image can be found at the [CD Burning](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Optical_disc_drive#Burning) and [USB Installation Media](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) pages at the [Arch Wiki.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
Also, specific instructions for installing Arch Linux using the TalkingArch live media can be found at the [TalkingArch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TalkingArch) wiki page.
